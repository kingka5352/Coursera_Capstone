According to the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107, representing the largest municipality in the United States with a density of at least 500 Korean Americans per square mile. Due to the high percentage of Koreans in this area as well as the increasing popularity of Korean food, Queens, NY is an ideal location to open a Korean restaurant.\n\nHowever, there are already so many Korean restaurants operating in this area and the market is highly competitive. As it is a highly developed city, the cost of doing business is also one of the highest. Thus, any new business venture or expansion needs to be analysed carefully.\n\nIn accordance with this, the idea of this study is to help Koreans who are planning to open new Korean restaurants in Queens, New York to choose the right location by providing relevant data.",
